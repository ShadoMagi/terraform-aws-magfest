            We are able to import shifts from last year. If you want us to import last year's shifts, please email 
            stops@magstock.org. You will still need to approve these via the checklist after the import. If you want 
            any shifts to be restricted to certain staffers, please use the "roles" function when creating shifts. 
            Shifts with a specific role will only be visible to staff that you have assigned to that role.
